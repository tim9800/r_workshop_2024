# Installing R and RStudio
You will need to install both R and RStudio to follow this workshop. The process is straightforward
and essentially the same for both Mac and Windows.

{% tabs install %}

{% tab install R %}

1. Go to the [install page](https://cran.rstudio.com/) for R

2. Under the heading **Download and Install R**, click the link that says "Download R for XYZ" (where XYZ is your operating system)

3. After downloading is finished, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions
- If prompted, give administrator privileges to the installer 
- Leaving all settings on their defaults is fine

<br>
### Extra steps for Mac Users

Mac users should also install XQuartz, a program which is needed for drawing plots on MacOS

1. Go to the [install page](https://www.xquartz.org/) for XQuartz

2. Click the install link (ends in .pkg )

3. After downloading is finished, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions

{% endtab %}

{% tab install RStudio %}

1. Go to the [install page](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) for RStudio

2. Under **2: Install RStudio**, click the download button. The button should say "Download RStudio for XYZ" (where XYZ is your operating system)

3. After downloading is finished, run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions
- If prompted, give administrator privileges to the installer
- Leaving all settings on their defaults is fine

4. Open RStudio and verify that it works
