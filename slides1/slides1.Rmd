## Housekeeping

1. Did you bring a laptop (Mac or Windows)?

2. Have you downloaded R and RStudio?

3. Have you downloaded XCode (Mac) or Rtools (Windows)?

If are stuck on Step 2 or 3, **please let us know now**

# The RStudio interface

name: rstudio info

## Navigating RStudio

RStudio is an **integrated development environment** for R. It is separate to R and makes life easier than just working with R.

## Basic functionality


Let's open our first R script and play around with the console. On the top left of the screen, navigate to `File > New File > R Script`

---
template: basicf
```{r calculator1, eval = FALSE}
> 1 + 1
```

---
template: basicf
```{r calculator2, eval = FALSE}
> 1 + 1
[1] 2
```

R can be used as a calculator

--

```{r autocomplete, eval = FALSE}
> read.
... (press tab twice!)
```

--

R can autocomplete commands

--

```{r help, eval = FALSE}
> ?read.csv()
```

--

R can give you help on unfamiliar commands

# Objects and functions

---
## What is an object?
In R we care about objects and their transformations

> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>
> *Everything that happens in R is a function call.* <br>
> **John Chambers**

R stores everything as objects

Objects

* Belong to **classes**

* Have content (in R, **values**) and structure

* Have **names**<sup>1</sup>

--

.footnote[[1] Not completely true. Hadley Wickham insists that names have objects<sup>[1](https://x.com/hadleywickham/status/732288980549390336?lang=en), [2](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#binding-basics)</sup>. To avoid this discussion, I will say that a name *refers to* or *references* an object.]

---
## Making and calling objects

To make an object, you must first come up with a valid name:

* Starts with a letter [A-Za-z]
* NOT starting with a number [0-9] or special character [._]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_object
.bad_name
1another_bad_name
```

Next, bind an object to the name using the `<-` operator

```{r}
my_object <- 123
```

To retrieve the object, we **call** the object by typing its name

```{r}
my_object
```


---
## Using objects

We just saw that an object's **name** can be used to access the information inside the object it refers to
* Like pronumerals in maths, $x = 123$

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_object + 1
sqrt(my_object)
my_object + my_object
```

--

What is the value of `my_object`?

--

```{r}
my_object
```

---
## Save your operations!
> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>
>
> Objects have **names**

`my_object + 1` is not an object, because we haven't assigned it a name

--

```{r}
new_object <- my_object + 1
new_object
```

--

Note that you can use the same name to store the result of `my_object + 1`. Try it!

```{r}
my_object <- my_object + 1
my_object
```

---
## Object classes
> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>

> Objects belong to **classes**
