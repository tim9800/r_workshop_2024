# The RStudio interface

name: rstudio info

## Navigating RStudio

RStudio is an **integrated development environment** for R. It is separate to R and makes life easier than just working with R.

## Basic functionality


Let's open our first R script and play around with the console. On the top left of the screen, navigate to `File > New File > R Script`

---
template: basicf
```{r calculator1, eval = FALSE}
> 1 + 1
```

---
template: basicf
```{r calculator2, eval = FALSE}
> 1 + 1
[1] 2
```

R can be used as a calculator

--

```{r autocomplete, eval = FALSE}
> read.
... (press tab twice!)
```

--

R can autocomplete commands

--

```{r help, eval = FALSE}
> ?read.csv()
```

--

R can give you help on unfamiliar commands

# Objects and functions

---
## What is an object?
In R we care about objects and their transformations

> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>
> *Everything that happens in R is a function call.* <br>
> **John Chambers**

R stores everything as objects

Objects

* Belong to **classes**

* Have content (in R, **values**)

* Have **names**<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Not completely true. Hadley Wickham insists that names have objects<sup>[1](https://x.com/hadleywickham/status/732288980549390336?lang=en), [2](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#binding-basics)</sup>. To avoid this discussion, I will say that a name *refers to* or *references* an object.]
