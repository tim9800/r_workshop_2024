## Navigating RStudio

RStudio is an **integrated development environment** for R. It is separate to R and makes life easier than working with 'just R'.

## Basic functionality


Let's open our first R script and play around with the console. On the top left of the screen, navigate to `File > New File > R Script`

---
template: basicf
```{r calculator1, eval = FALSE}
> 1 + 1
```

---
template: basicf
```{r calculator2, eval = FALSE}
> 1 + 1
[1] 2
```

R can be used as a calculator

--

```{r autocomplete, eval = FALSE}
> read.
... (press tab twice!)
```

--

R can autocomplete commands

--

```{r help, eval = FALSE}
> ?read.csv()
```

--

R can give you help on unfamiliar commands

# Objects

---
## What is an object?
In R we care about objects and their transformations

> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>
> *Everything that happens in R is a function call.* <br>
> **John Chambers**

R stores everything as objects

Objects

* Belong to **classes**

* Are **structured**

* Have **names**<sup>*</sup>

--

.footnote[<sup>\*</sup>Not completely true. Hadley Wickham insists that names have objects<sup>[1](https://x.com/hadleywickham/status/732288980549390336?lang=en), [2](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/names-values.html#binding-basics)</sup>. To avoid this discussion, whenever I say an object has a name, this means that the name *refers to* or *references* the object.]

---
## Making and calling objects

To make an object, you must first come up with a valid name:

* Starts with a letter [A-Za-z]
* NOT starting with a number [0-9] or special character [._]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_object
.bad_name
1another_bad_name
```

Next, bind an object to the name using the `<-` operator

```{r}
my_object <- 123
```

To retrieve the object, we **call** the object by typing its name

```{r}
my_object
```


---
## Using objects

We just saw that an object's **name** can be used to access the information inside the object it refers to
* Like pronumerals in maths, $x = 123$

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_object + 1
sqrt(my_object)
my_object + my_object
```

--

What is the value of `my_object`?

--

```{r}
my_object
```

---
## Save your operations!
> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>
>
> Objects have **names**

`my_object + 1` is not an object, because we haven't bound it to a name

--

```{r}
new_object <- my_object + 1
new_object
```

--

Note that you can use the same name to store the result of `my_object + 1`. Try it!

```{r}
my_object <- my_object + 1
my_object
```

---
## Object classes
> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>
>
> Objects belong to **classes**

There are six *atomic* classes in R

.pull-left[
Here are the four common classes:
<br>
<br>
* `numeric`: the real numbers

* `integer`: the integers

* `character`: 'textual' information

* `logical`: `TRUE`, `FALSE` and `NA`
]

.pull-right[
And here's how to make objects of each class:

```{r}
num <- 123

int <- 123L

char <- "123" # Use double quotes to create character objects

logi <- TRUE
```
]
---
## `class()`

The `class()` function returns the class of the object you use it on

```{r}
class(num)
class(int)
class(char)
class(logi)
```


---
## Vectors
> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>
>
> Objects are **structured**

Vectors are:
* A kind of data structure
* A **homogenous** collection of elements (i.e. all the elements belong to the
same class)

--

Create vectors using the function `c()`, short for "combines", on the elements
you want to put into the vector

```{r}
survey_age <- c(15, 25, 27, 18) # A numeric vector

survey_gender <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male") # A character vector
```

---
## Factors

Factors are a kind of vector well-suited to storing **categorical data**.

Create factors by using `factor()` on character vectors:

```{r}
gender_factor <- factor(survey_gender)
gender_factor
```


---
## Functions
> *Everything that happens in R is a function call*

Functions

* Are objects, so they are referenced by **names**

* Are bundles of instructions that take an input and return some useful output

Function calls are indicated by sets of open and closed brackets

* `c()`

* `factor()`


---

## Structure of a function

The inputs we give to a function are called **arguments**. Arguments:

* live inside the brackets of a function call

* change the behaviour of the function, depending on the argument's value.
<br><br>

What kind of arguments does a function expect?

```{r}
?sqrt # This works with or without the brackets

```

Because `sqrt` only takes one argument, we can call it in two ways:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sqrt(x = 4) # Named argument
sqrt(4)     # Positional argument
```

---
## Functions with multiple arguments

When a function has multiple arguments, it is best to use named arguments unless
the argument is the first one

```{r}
num_data <- c(3, 3, 3, NA)
mean(num_data, na.rm = T)
```

--

Many function arguments have defaults, if you don't tell the function what you want

```{r}
mean(num_data)
```

--

Which arguments have defaults? And what are they?

* `?` is your best friend


---
## Save your function calls!
> *Everything that exists in R is an object.* <br>
>
> Objects have **names**

The result of `sqrt(4)` isn't an object until we give it a name!

```{r}
sqrt_of_4 <- sqrt(4)
sqrt_of_4
```

```{r}
mean_of_three_3s <- mean(c(3, 3, 3, NA), na.rm = T)
mean_of_three_3s

```

# Working with external data

---
## Put everything in one place

Having all your files, R scripts, and spreadsheets in one **directory** (folder)
makes it easy to work with external data.

Exercise:

1. Minimise RStudio and find a place on your computer to save the script you've
been working on

2. Make a folder there

3. Go back to RStudio, and `File > Save As.. > [Location you chose]`

4. Download the [workshop dataset](https://tim9800.github.io/r_workshop_2024/data/neurobio_synthetic.csv) and **put it into the folder you just made**

---
## The working directory

The **working directory** is the folder where R saves and looks for files.

What is your current working directory?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
getwd() # Probably not where you want
```

How do we set our working directory to the folder we want?
<br>

--

&emsp; Option 1: `Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory ...`

--

&emsp; Option 2: Close R Studio, and double click on the .R Script you just saved,
in the folder you saved it in

--

&emsp; Option 3 (slow): 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
setwd("C:/Location/to/your/file.R")
```

---
## Reading in .csv files


```{r, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = "hide"}
df <- read.csv("../data/neurobio_synthetic.csv")
```

Let's read in (convert to an R object) the dataset we just downloaded and assign
it to the name `df`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df <- read.csv("neurobio_synthetic.csv")
```

What now? Here's a list of short **base R** functions I like to use to glimpse at
my data

* `View(df)`

* `names(df)`

* `str(df)`: **str**ucture of a dataframe

* `df$...`: View one variable (...) of the dataframe

* `table(df$...)`: Frequency table of (...)

---
## Writing to .csv files

While `read.csv` converts a .csv file into a dataframe for you to work on, `write.csv` converts the dataframe back into a .csv file:

```{r}
write.csv(df,
          file = "neurobio_synthetic_updated.csv")
```



---
## Saving and loading R objects

Generally speaking, you won't need to save R objects. The contents of your script should be sufficient to reproduce the objects you need.

By default, R Studio will ask if you want to save your Environment (with all your R objects) when you exit

![save workspace](https://tim9800.github.io/r_workshop_2024/img/save_workspace.png)
---
## Saving and loading R objects

Alternatively, you can save a single R object with

```{r}
saveRDS(df,
        file = "neurobio_synthetic_updated.RDS")
```

To read a single object into R, use:

```{r}
df_read <- readRDS(file = "neurobio_synthetic_updated.RDS")
```

As always, remember to assign your function calls to a name!

<img src="https://tim9800.github.io/r_workshop_2024/img/tidyverse_logo.png" class="embed-right-icon">
## What is tidyverse?



The tidyverse is a set of **packages** for R that "share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures" of tidy data.<sup>[3](https://www.tidyverse.org/)</sup>

* **tidy**: one row per observation, one column per variable

  * 'Long data' (preferred) vs. 'wide data'

* Replaces a lot of clunky base R syntax with **verbs**

--

<img src="https://tim9800.github.io/r_workshop_2024/img/hadley.jpg" class = "embed-right-small">

* Developed in principal by Hadley Wickham <sup>[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadley_Wickham)</sup>

    * R for Data Science <sup>[5](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)</sup>
    
    * Advanced R <sup>[6](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/)</sup>
    
---
## Installing tidyverse

As tidyverse is an external package, we must install it before we can use it.

To install packages, we use the function `install.packages()` on tidyverse (quoted)

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse") # Try autocomplete!
```

After installing a package, we must attach it to R to use its features. Let's do this by calling the `library()` function on tidyverse (no quotes)

```{r}
library(tidyverse) # Autocomplete to the rescue
```

**Notes**
* `install.packages("package")` is used once
* `library(package)` is used *every time you open R*
* Repeat this process for each package you want to use


---
name: select

## `select()`: column-wise subsetting

This function allows us to **select** a subset of variables in our data.

--

template: select

Let's remind ourselves of the variables we're working with

```{r, eval = FALSE}
names(df)
```

--

**Example 1**: Selecting 1 variable

```{r, eval = TRUE, R.options=list(max.print=5)}
df_select_1 <- select(df, age)
df_select_1
```

---
template: select

**Example 2**: Select multiple variables

```{r, eval = TRUE, R.options=list(max.print=15)}
df_select_2 <- select(df, age, sex_at_birth.factor, scid_mdd_current)
df_select_2
```

---
template: select

**Example 3**: Select consecutive variables using the `:` operator

```{r, eval = TRUE, R.options=list(max.print=20)}
df_select_3 <- select(df, age:sofas_score)
df_select_3
```


---
template: select

**Example 4**: Select variables which start with "scid"

```{r, eval = TRUE, R.options=list(max.print=15)}
df_select_4 <- select(df, starts_with("scid"))
df_select_4
```

---
template: select

There are many more **tidy selection helpers**. Check them out using
`?select`

* `ends_with("...")` - select variables ending in "..."

* `!` - put this in front of a helper to **negate it**

* `c()` - combine multiple helpers, e.g. `c(age, sex_at_birth.factor, ends_with(".factor")`

* `where(is.numeric)` - select only numeric variables

---
## `|>`: pipes<sup>*</sup>

Pipes are a convenient way to chain functions together.

**Example** Consider the following selections

```{r}
df_select_5 <- select(df, starts_with("s"))

df_select_6 <- select(df_select_5, starts_with("scid"))
```

--

In plain English, `|>` means 'use whatever comes before me as input for whatever comes after me'.

```{r}
df_select_pipe <- df |>
  select(starts_with("s")) |>
  select(starts_with("scid"))
```


.footnote[<sup>*</sup> `|>` can also be written as `%>%` <sup>[7](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2023/04/base-vs-magrittr-pipe/)</sup>]


---
name:filter

## `filter()`: row-wise subsetting

This function allows us to **filter** *in* observations using logical expressions.

--

**Example 1**: Filter in those who are 18+

```{r, eval = TRUE, R.options=list(max.print=20)}
df_filter_1 <- df |> # Pipe df into filter() as an input
  filter(age >= 18)

```

**Example 2**: Filter in 18-year-olds

```{r}
df_filter_2 <- df |>
  filter(age == 18) # == is different to =
```

**Example 3**: Filter out 18-year-olds

```{r}
df_filter_3 <- df |>
  filter(age != 18) # != means 'is not equal to'
```

---
template: filter

**Example 4**: Filter in participants who are in between 18 and 35 years old

```{r}
df_filter_4 <- df |>
  filter(age %in% 18:35)
```

--

**Example 5**: Filter in participants who are in clinical stage 1a or 1b

```{r}
df_filter_5 <- df |>
  filter(clinical_stage.factor %in% c("1a", "1b"))
```

--

**Example 6** Filter in participants who are between 18 and 35 years old, AND
who are in clinical stage 1a or 1b

```{r}
df_filter_6 <- df |>
  filter(clinical_stage.factor %in% c("1a", "1b") &
           age %in% 18:35)

```

---
template: filter

**Example 7**: Filter in participants who do not have *NA* (missing value) for
`scid_completed`

```{r}
df_filter_7 <- df |>
  filter(!is.na(scid_completed.factor))
```

--

### Summary

* Filter cuts down the rows of a dataset by using **logical expressions**

* A logical expression is one that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE

* A logical expression can contain logical operators, such as `>`, `==`,
`!=` and `%in%`

* A logical expression can be a function that evaluates to TRUE or FALSE, like
`is.na()`

---
## `mutate()`: make new variables

Create new variables, or modify existing ones, with `mutate()`

Syntax

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df |>
  mutate(new_variable = do_something(old_variable))
```

* `new_variable` is the name of the variable you want to create. This can be:

  * A completely new name --> creates new variable
  * A name that already exists in the dataset --> modifies that variable
  
* `do_something()` is something that transforms `old_variable`, e.g.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
df |>
  mutate(new_variable = old_variable + 2)
```

---
## `mutate()`: make new variables

**Example 1**: Create a new variable of Z-scores for each participant's QIDS score

Recall that we can calculate z-scores using:<br><br>

.pull-left[
  $$z = \frac{x - \bar{x}}{\sigma}$$
]

$x$ = `qidsc_total_score`  
$\bar{x}$ = `mean(qidsc_total_score)`  
$\sigma$ = `sd(qidsc_total_score)`

<br>
--

```{r}
df_mutate_1 <- df |>
  filter(qidsc_total_score != 999) |> # Filter out missings
  mutate(qidsc_total_score_z = 
           qidsc_total_score - mean(qidsc_total_score) /
           sd(qidsc_total_score))

```

---
## `mutate()`: make new variables

**Example 1**: Create a new variable of Z-scores for each participant's QIDS score

Let's quickly compare the z-score variable with the raw QIDS total
score

```{r, R.options=list(max.print=10)}
df_mutate_1 |>
  select(qidsc_total_score, qidsc_total_score_z)
```

**Something's a bit fishy with these z-scores ...**

---
## `mutate()`: make new variables

**Example 1**: Create a new variable of Z-scores for each participant's QIDS score

```{r}
df_mutate_1 <- df |>
  filter(qidsc_total_score != 999) |> # Filter out missings
  mutate(qidsc_total_score_z = 
           qidsc_total_score - mean(qidsc_total_score) / #<<
           sd(qidsc_total_score))

```

--

We forgot to put brackets around the numerator! Let's fix that

---
## `mutate()`: make new variables

**Example 2**: Turn SOFAS score (0-100) into a proportion (0-1)

```{r, R.options=list(max.print=26)}
df_mutate_2 <- df |>
  filter(sofas_score != 999) |> # Filter out missings
  mutate(sofas_score = sofas_score / 100)
df_mutate_2$sofas_score
```

---
## `mutate()`: make new variables

**Example 2**: Turn SOFAS score (0-100) into a proportion (0-1)

```{r, R.options=list(max.print=26)}
df_mutate_2 <- df |>
  filter(sofas_score != 999) |> # Filter out missings
  mutate(sofas_score = sofas_score / 100) #<<
df_mutate_2$sofas_score
```

Because we have `sofas_score` on both sides of the statement, we modify `sofas_score` instead of making a new variable

---
name: mutate case when
## `mutate()` + `case_when()`

Mutate can be combined with the dplyr verb case_when() to create a variable
using a complex combination of other variables

--
template: mutate case when

* Creating categorical variables (factors) from numeric variables

* Recoding specific values within a numeric variable

---
template: mutate case when


**Example 1**: Categorise participants as children (<18), youth (18-35) or adult (>35)

```{r}
df_mutate_cw_1 <- df |>
  mutate(
    age_group = case_when(
      age < 18 ~ "Child",
      age >= 18 & age <= 35 ~ "Youth",
      age > 35 ~ "Adult"
      ) |>
      as.factor() # Converts age_group into a factor
  )
```

---
template: mutate case when

**Example 2**: Recode SOFAS variable so that the 999s are converted to `NA`

```{r}
df_mutate_cw_2 <- df |>
  mutate(
    sofas_score = case_when(
      sofas_score == 999 ~ NA,
      .default = sofas_score
    )
  )
```
