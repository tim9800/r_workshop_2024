## Housekeeping

1. Did you bring a laptop (Mac or Windows)?

2. Have you downloaded R and RStudio?

3. **Have you downloaded XCode (Mac only)?**
    * Allows Mac users to display plots properly
    
### Quick tips

* Hit `Ctrl + Enter` or `âŒ˜ + Enter` to run lines of code quickly

* You can copy code from these slides easily. Click 'Copy Code' on the top right of any code chunk

```{r}
# Copy me!
```

## Overview

1. Plotting with `ggplot2`

.center[Break for 15 minutes]

<ol start="2">
  <li>Statistical tests</li>
    

---

## Setting up the workspace

Having all your files, R scripts, and spreadsheets in one **directory** (folder)
makes it easy to work with external data.

1. Open a new R script and find a good location on your computer

2. Make a folder at this location

3. Go back to RStudio, and `File > Save As.. > [Location you chose]`

4. Download the [workshop dataset](https://tim9800.github.io/r_workshop_2024/data/neurobio_synthetic.csv) and **put it into the folder you just made**

5. Load the dataset into R by running 

```{r}
df <- read.csv("neurobio_synthetic.csv")
```

## Installing `ggplot2`


If you've already installed `tidvyerse` (you did if you attended Workshop 1), and loaded `tidyverse` with

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```


You're all set!

--

If you haven't installed `tidyverse` and don't plan to, you can install `ggplot2` on its own by running

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

---

## A broad overview

`ggplot2` lets us build plots in a modular way. This means we decide what "modules" go into our plots and how these modules look like.

.pull-left[
#### Layers

The modules of a `ggplot`
* `ggplot()` is the base layer
* Each layer has its own line of code
* Each layer is separated by a `+`

#### Aesthetics

The way we control how each layer looks like
]

.pull-right[

```{r, eval = F}

ggplot()
```

]

---

## Layer up

The first layer is always `ggplot()`. Try calling ggplot() without any arguments

```{r, eval = F}
ggplot()
```

Typically, you supply `ggplot()` with the **dataset** and **global aesthetics** (more on this soon).

The next layers you write will depend on what you want. There are many things you can go for:

* `geom_point()`: scatterplot
* `geom_line()`: line graph
* `geom_bar()`: bar chart, with height proportional to frequency
* `theme_bw()`: change the theme to black and white
* `labs()`: change the title, subtitle, X-axis label, Y-axis label etc.


---

## Aestheticking

* Setting - DON'T depend on data. "Set and forget"

```{r}
```


* Mapping - DO depend on data.

Setting and mapping can be done:

* Within a specific layer - aesthetic changes apply only to that layer

* Within the `ggplot()` base layer - aesthetic changes apply to every layer
