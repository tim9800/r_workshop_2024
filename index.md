# Introduction to R

## Before the workshop

1. [Installing R and R Studio](https://tim9800.github.io/r_workshop_2024/installation.html)
2. [Installing tools for compiling packages](https://tim9800.github.io/r_workshop_2024/compilation.html)
3. [Installing `tidyverse`](https://tim9800.github.io/r_workshop_2024/tidyverse.html)

	* STEP 3 IS OPTIONAL. We will go through this step in the workshop as well, but it will be handy if you can do this step before coming

## Further readings and resources

* [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/) A freely available, online textbook written by the tidyverse authors that covers everything in this workshop and more. The textbook includes exercises and [solutions](https://mine-cetinkaya-rundel.github.io/r4ds-solutions/) if you want to develop a deeper understanding of tidyverse.

* [Advanced R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) A cool textbook that goes deeper into the inner workings of R. It covers functions in a lot of detail, objects, expressions and evaluation of code.

* [RStudio "Cheatsheet"](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) A cheatsheet is a visual guide to using a program or application.

* [How to style your code (short version)](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html)

* [How to style your code (long version)](https://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html)
